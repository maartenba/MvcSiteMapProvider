Follow these steps to manually install an external Dependency Injection container
into your project.

1. Copy the contents of the desired dependency injection container project into
your MVC application in the exact same directories.

2. Copy the contents of the Shared project into the exact same directories 
in your MVC application. Do not copy the DIConfig.cs file from this project.

3. Open up the MvcSiteMap[xxx] module. The name will vary depending on 
the dependency injection container. Locate this line near the top of
the file:

string[] includeAssembliesForScan = new string[] { "$AssemblyName$" };

Change the name from "$AssemblyName$" to the assembly name of your MVC
project, which is usually the project name. Be sure to remove the $ characters.

4. Add any missing dependencies to your MVC application using the 
dependency injection project for your desired container here as a guide.

5. Add (or change) this key to the appSettings section of your web.config file:
<add key="MvcSiteMapProvider_UseExternalDIContainer" value="true" />

6. If you need to use IDependencyResolver, add "DependencyResolver" 
(without the quotes) as a conditional compilation constant
to your MVC project. This can be done by going to the Build tab under 
project Properties, and adding the value to the end of the list. 
These symbols should be separated by a semicolon (;). 
If you are getting runtime errors, you should try this setting.

Alternatively, you can edit the App_Start/DIConfigBootstrapper.cs file 
to achieve the same result.
